To learn:
causing harm is cruel??
injure(bird), interact(robert, bird) :- robert harms bird
event_subject(robert, harm) -> property(cruel, robert)

each sentence has a notion of harming someone
learn idea about harm, and extend to each
this links in with harm

propert(cruel, tp)
property(person, tp)
property(cruel, person)
properrty(cruel, tp)

what would have been body, switch to being abducibles instead
allow learning some aribtrary head tokens?
types?

for a given problem, let P be the set of predicates extracted from the problem
for each event / property predicate, introduce:
 Background rules:
 predicate(G, X) :- predicate(Y, X) = P, group(G), not abnormal_group(G, predicate(Y, X))
...
predicate(gn, X) :- predicate(from_problem, X), where n is number of groups to introduce
